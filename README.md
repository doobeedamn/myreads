# MyReads Project

A React application. MyReads allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Installation

* clone the git repo
* run npm install
* run npm start
* view the app in your browser at localhost:3000

## App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* ReactDOM

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The main page also has a link to SEARCH, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
